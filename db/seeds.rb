            [Verse 1: Drake]
            I got car money, fresh start money
            I want Saudi money, I want art money
            I want women to cry and pour out they heart for me
            And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
            Yeah, and lately I do bitches the meanest
            Tell 'em I love 'em and don't ever mean it
            We go on dates, I send the Maybach out in neighborhoods
            They never seen it
            That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient, I ain't lying
            Yeah, and comfortable I sit
            That manual Ferrari Italia's some fly shit
            It's sitting at the house like I bought it in '96
            'Cause honestly I'm too fucking busy to drive stick, I swear
            Too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'
            This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
            Been hot before they open doors for me, pre-heated oven
            I'm in this ho
            But I ain't finished though, it's been a minute though
            My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
            And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
            Luckily, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
            So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
            Dreams money can buy
            Everybody yelled 'Surprise!', I wasn't surprised
            That's only 'cause I been waiting on it, nigga
            So fuck whoever hating on a nigga
            Of course...

            And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
            YMCMB
            These niggas make it so hard to be friendly
            When I know part of it's envy
            Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far, these are empty
            I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
            Ooh! I never seen the car you claim to drive
            Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside
            And I feel like lately, it went from top five to remaining five
            My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive
            And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
            We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
            And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
            Then I'll probably give her my number
            Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
            And they land on the stage you dance on
            We got company coming over
            Would it kill you to put some pants on?
            Dreams money can buy
            They told me it's like a high, and it wasn't a lie, yeah
            Just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga

            In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
            And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
            On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
            Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song

            'Cause we said 'no strings attached' and I still got tied up in that
            Everything that I write is either for her or about her
            So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
            The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
            Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
            I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
            Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

            And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
            Really, that's it to me
            Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
            Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
            They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
            The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie

            That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
            Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
            Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
            I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me

            Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
            The bitch is trendy
            My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
            I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
            Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
            How much money can this casino lend me?
            Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
            Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
            To me, Benihana is pigeon food
            This not a forgivin' mood
            So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
            I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
            Keepin' my connections strictly physical
            Everyone that's married is miserable
            I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
            The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
            I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
            It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
            Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
            Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
            This shit could last forever

            I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
            Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
            Haunted houses
            I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
            Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
            Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
            Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
            Never go the same places they go
            Separate vacations
            A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
            I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
            I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
            Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
            I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
            Man, truth be told, I think about it often
            The petty king, the overseer of many things
            I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
            I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
            West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
            Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
            Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
            The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
            But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
            Years later, none greater

            Yeah, yeah

            [Verse 1: Drake]
            I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
            I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
            I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
            Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
            Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
            I got two phones, one need a charge
            Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
            I got big packs comin' on the way
            I got big stacks comin' out the safe
            I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
            It's a big gap between us in the game
            In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
            When I die, put my money in the grave

            [Chorus: Drake]
            When I die, put my money in the grave
            I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
            Really just lapped every nigga in the race
            I really might tat 'Realest Nigga' on my face
            Lil CC let it slap with the bass
            I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
            Now I'm like, 'Nah, love, I'm good, go away'
            Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

            [Verse 2: Drake]
            I was on top when that shit meant a lot
            Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
            Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
            Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
            I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
            Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
            Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
            Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

            [Verse 3: Rick Ross]
            Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
            She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
            Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
            When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
            Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
            Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
            Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
            I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
            Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
            Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yÃ©
            Lil' nigga, just another state case
            Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
            Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
            You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
            A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
            Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
            Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
            And I'll never talk about it (About it)
            The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
            Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
            'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
            Want the house (House)
            You could DM my accountant
            My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
            Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
            These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
            Ross got it (Maybach Music)

            [Chorus: Drake]
            When I die, put my money in the grave
            I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
            Really just lapped every nigga in the race
            I really might tat 'Realest Nigga' on my face
            Lil CC let it slap with the bass
            I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
            Now I'm like, 'Nah, love, I'm good, go away'
            Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it")
